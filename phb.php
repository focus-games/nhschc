								This page gives detail about Personal Health Budgets (PHB).</p>
								
								<p>A Personal Health Budget is an amount of money to support a person's identified health and wellbeing needs, planned and agreed between the person and their local NHS team. It is not new money, but it is money that would normally have been spent by the NHS on a person's care, being spent more flexibly to meet their identified needs.
Personal Health Budgets enable people to have greater choice, flexibility and control over the healthcare and support they receive.
</p>
								
								<p>To make it easier the process has been split into 6 sections which are listed in the buttons below.

																<h2>Making contact and getting clear information</h2>
											
							
						<p>A Personal Health Budget is an amount of money to support a person's identified health and wellbeing needs, planned and agreed between the person and their local NHS team or healthcare professional. It is not new money, but a different way of spending health funding to meet a person's identified needs.</p>
						<p>Personal Health Budgets enable people to have greater choice, flexibility and control over the healthcare and support they receive.</p>
						
						<p>Personal Health Budgets can be managed in one of three ways, or a combination of these:</p>
						
						
						<p><strong>Notional budget:</strong> The NHS holds the money on behalf of the individual. The person knows how much their budget is and discusses with the NHS the care and support they require to meet their needs. The NHS purchases the agreed care and support.</p>
						<p><strong>A third party budget:</strong> An organisation independent of the individual and the NHS holds the budget and makes the arrangements for the agreed care and support. If the budget is used to employ personal assistants, it is the organisation holding the budget who is their registered employer.</p>
						<p><strong>A direct payment:</strong> Money is paid directly into the individual's (or their representative's) bank account and they can directly purchase the care and support required in line with the agreed personalised care and support plan.</p>

							<h2 style="font-size: 1.4em;">Working out the amount of money available</h2>
						
							<p>An indicative budget is the initial calculation of how much money the person is likely to need to meet their assessed care and support needs. NHS care is free at the point of delivery and in NHS Continuing Healthcare the Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are financially responsible for all of the person’s assessed health and associated social care needs - the budget must be sufficient to meet these assessed needs. 
The assessment of need completed in Step 2 provides information to inform indicative budget setting. 

</p>
						
						<p>CCGs will have their own local processes for setting and agreeing budgets. These will be determined by a number of different things, for example, the way in which services are already commissioned and the money already available to meet people's care and support needs.</p>
						
						<p>Regardless of how budgets are set, it is important to remember that people need to know upfront how much money they have to spend on their care and support and, how this was calculated to enable them to effectively plan the care and support they need.</p>
						
						<p>CCGs should review their budget setting models at regular intervals to ensure indicative cost calculations are compliant with any changes in statutory requirements (e.g. changes in national minimum wage, pension contributions, employers national insurance contributions etc.) and financially viable for the local marketplace.</p>

							<h2 style="font-size: 1.4em;">Developing a personalised care and support plan</h2>
						
							<p>At the centre of a Personal Health Budget is a personalised care and support plan. 
The personalised care and support plan should clearly set out the health needs that the Personal Health Budget is to address and be agreed between the NHS and the person receiving the Personal Health Budget.</p>
      												<p>The personalised care and support plan should set out the outcomes that are intended to be achieved and how the budget will be spent to enable the person to meet these outcomes. It is important for CCGs to be flexible when agreeing budget-spend, as far as possible, to enable people to live as they would like within the context of their health condition.</p>
      												
      												<p>A good personalised care and support planning discussion will identify a person’s strengths, skills and personal circumstances as well as their health needs. It will identify what is working and not working from their perspective, what is important to the person and what is important for their health.</p>
      												
      												<p>Support for personalised care and support planning can take many forms. Support may be from the person’s healthcare professional, but people may prefer an independent person to guide them through the process and liaise with the relevant parties. As with each aspect of a Personal Health Budget, the best approach is to ask the person what would work for them and not assume that the same option suits everyone.</p>
      												
      											<p>It is important to include the support of advocacy where appropriate. This will help ensure that people are able to make informed decisions in their best interests, and that they do not find the process overly burdensome or overwhelming.</p>
      												
      												<p>The personalised care and support plan should be recorded in a format that best suits the person and should be easily accessible for them - whether in paper, digital, pictorial or other format.</p>
      												
      												<p>When agreeing the personalised care and support plan, the CCG needs to be satisfied that:</p>
      												<ul>
      													<li>The person’s health needs can be met through the care and support set out in the plan</li>
      													<li>The amount of money is enough to cover the full cost of the care and support agreed to meet the person’s outcomes</li>
      													<li>The plan can be reviewed as required </li>
      													<li>There is an appropriate risk management plan that's been developed with the person</li>
      													<li>Where people lack capacity or are more vulnerable, procedures such as safeguarding and promoting liberty have been included appropriately</li>
      												</ul>
      												
      												<p>The individual or their representative must also agree that:</p>
      												<ul>
      													<li>The person’s care needs will be met by the care and support agreed in the plan</li>
      													<li>The amount of money available is sufficient to cover the full cost of the plan</li>
      													<li>The plan will be reviewed and their needs may be re-assessed as part of that review (as set out in Step 2)</li>

																<h2>Organising support for care and outcomes</h2>
																
						<p>Once the personalised care and support plan and final budget amount have been agreed, a number of processes need to be completed to enable the Personal Health Budget to work well.   
</p>
      					<p>For notional Personal Health Budgets, where the CCG commissions care and support on behalf of the person, these processes will be completed by the CCG. Processes to support third party budgets are managed between the CCG and the third party budget provider. For both these budget management options, the person should be included in discussions for setting up care and support, even though they are not directly involved in the administrative aspects of the care and support arrangements.</p>
      												
      					<p>For direct payments, the CCG and the person should work with the direct payment support service organisation to ensure that all necessary steps have been completed to enable the Personal Health Budget to work well. These include:</p>
      												
      												
														<p><b>Signing a direct payment agreement:</b> The direct payment agreement sets out the terms and conditions for how the personal health budget must be used and must be signed by the NHS and the individual or their representative before any money is released by the NHS.</p>
														
														<p><b>Employing personal assistants:</b> Taking a Personal Health Budget as a direct payment offers people the option of directly employing their own personal assistants.  Any use of a direct payment to employ personal assistants must be compliant with existing tax and employment legislation. CCGs are required to provide information, advice and support to people who wish to become employers, including access to support services e.g. payroll services, managed account services etc. Further information can also be accessed through the following websites:</p>
														<ul>

      												</ul>
														
														
														<p><b>Disclosure and Barring:</b> When deciding whether or not to employ someone, people should follow best practice in relation to safeguarding, vetting and barring. Section 7.4 of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/guid-dirct-paymnt.pdf">Guidance on direct payments for healthcare</a> provides information and advice on best practice.

      												</ul>
														
														
														<p><b>Training:</b> The personalised care and support planning process should identify the training requirements for all staff involved in supporting the person to meet their assessed health needs and achieve their agreed outcomes, and provide information on where and how to access this training. The Personal Health Budget should include costs to meet these training needs if they are being provided by personal assistants; where health needs and support to achieve agreed outcomes are provided by a registered care provider, training costs are generally covered within the agency costs.</p>
														
														
														<p><b>Providing support for delegated healthcare tasks:</b> All staff (personal assistants or care agency workers) involved in the provision of support for health needs will be required to undertake training and competency sign-off for specific healthcare tasks which have been delegated by a registered healthcare professional. NHS England has produced guidance to support CCGs in ensuring that delegation of healthcare tasks, provision of training and review of competencies are managed in a safe and effective way <a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/516_Delegation-of-healthcare-tasks-to-personal-assistants_S7.pdf"> Delegation of healthcare tasks to personal assistants</a>
</p>
														<p><b>Insurance:</b> Ensuring all necessary insurances are in place where personal assistants are directly employed.</p>
     												
														<p><b>CQC compliance:</b> Guidance from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) provides information on the CQC registration requirements of staff providing care and support to people in their own homes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20151230_100001_Scope_of_registration_guidance_updated_March_2015_01.pdf">CQC: The scope of registration</a> <em>This does not apply to directly employed personal assistants.</em></p>

      												
      					<p>CCGs will also need to provide ongoing guidance and support to people who are employing personal assistants, to manage the way in which personal assistants work - for example if the person receiving care and support is admitted to hospital or how to manage redundancy payments if the direct payment comes to an end.</p>

																<h2>Monitoring and review</h2>
																
							
					<p>Personal Health Budgets and personalised care and support plans should be reviewed initially within the first three months and then on an annual basis. However, reviews may also take place at other times, for example, where there is a change in clinical needs, or at the request of the person. People should have upfront information about the frequency of reviews and what will be expected during the process.</p>
     												
      												<p>At all times there should be a clear separation between review of the personalised care and support plan and budget, audit of the direct payment, and eligibility assessment for NHS Continuing Healthcare.</p>
      												
      												<p>Regardless of how budgets are set, it is important to remember that people need to know upfront how much money they have to spend on their care and support and, how this was calculated to enable them to effectively plan the care and support they need.</p>
      												
      												<p>Whilst CCGs should endeavor to co-ordinate reviews for NHS Continuing Healthcare eligibility and Personal Health Budgets within a similar timeframe, they should be mindful of not over-burdening people and families e.g. not to schedule these for the same day.</p>
      												
      												<p>A review should address:</p>
      												<ul>
      												<li>How well the personalised care and support plan is meeting the person’s health needs and their agreed outcomes, and identifying any new outcomes.</li>
      												<li>Whether health needs have changed, and if so whether the personalised care and support plan needs updating.</li>
      												<li>Whether the Personal Health Budget has been used effectively and appropriately.</li>
      												<li>Whether the risks have changed and whether the risk management is still effective.</li>
      												<li>Whether the Personal Health Budget is sufficient to cover the full cost of each of the services identified to meet the person’s assessed needs and identified outcomes.</li>
      												</ul>
      												
      												<p>Actions identified during a review should be followed up in a timely way. Any changes to the budget should be discussed in an open and transparent way, and people should be aware of the process to manage any disputes should they not be satisfied with the proposed changes.</p>
      												
      												<p>People should be given opportunities for an informal review to check that they are managing the budget in the way they have been asked to and should know who to contact if they are worried about anything. </p>
      												
      												<p>CCGs can use the review process to identify any market development opportunities or pin point gaps in the availability of services and support that people may wish to purchase with their Personal Health Budget. The review process may also signal the need to review budget setting approaches to ensure budgets offered are financially viable and people have sufficient funds available to purchase care and support based on local market rates.</p>
      												
      												<p>Personal Health Budget reviews should be a supportive process and a positive experience for people, not a means to enforce compliance.</p>
