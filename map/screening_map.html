      													<h2>Proportionate Screening Using Checklist</h2><br>
<p>CCGs, along with their local authority (LA) partners, should agree pro-active systems to ensure that screening arrangements are effective across all settings and for <b style="color: #000">all</b> adult client groups. They should have in place agreed protocols that include arrangements for proportionate and timely use of the Checklist in accordance with the National Framework 2018 requirements. This should include when it is not necessary or appropriate to screen for NHS Continuing Healthcare.</p>

<p>LAs and CCGs should work together to ensure that the decision whether or not to Checklist, and the completion of Checklists, are undertaken by practitioners with the relevant skills and training. </p> 

<p>The decision to undertake CHC screening should be based on the needs and situation of the individual, rather than on administrative or organisational requirements (e.g. screening purely because the individual’s case is being considered by an LA funding panel).</p> 

<p>Health and Social Care agencies are responsible for ensuring that any Checklists completed by their staff are of good quality and accurately reflect the individual’s needs. </p> 

<p>CCGs should not impose disproportionate quality assurance mechanisms for Checklists which result in a barrier to, or delay in, individuals being referred for CHC assessment. Positive Checklists should be acted upon as soon as possible unless critical information is missing, in which case the missing information should be obtained without delay.</p> 

<p>Where poor practice regarding screening is identified in a team/environment then targeted intervention (for example bespoke training) should be provided in order to address the issues.</p>

<p>CCGs and system partners should agree an escalation process if cases are being Checklisted inappropriately or are being denied a Checklist inappropriately. This could form part of the locally agreed dispute resolution process/policy.</p> 

<p>Arrangements must be in place to inform individuals and/or their representatives of the outcome of the Checklist (whether positive or negative) in writing. There should be agreement between health and social care agencies as to how this requirement will be met, bearing in mind that Checklists are completed by a wide range of practitioners across different organisations.</p> 

<p>Health and social care agencies should agree arrangements to ensure that the CCG receives completed Checklists as soon as possible after completion and also that it keeps a record of the outcome of all Checklists completed, both positive and negative.</p>

      													<h2>When to complete a Checklist</h2><br>
      												<p>Screening and assessment of eligibility for NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) should be at the right time and location for the individual, and when their ongoing needs are known. Screening is required when there may be a need for CHC. Local health and social care joint processes should be in place to identify individuals for whom it may be appropriate to complete a Checklist, including for individuals in community settings. Wherever an individual requires a long-term care home placement with nursing or has significant support needs, a Checklist would be expected to be completed (unless the decision is made to go straight to the completion of a Decision Support Tool).</p>
								
						<p>Before the Checklist is applied, practitioners should ensure that the individual and (where appropriate) their representative, understands that the Checklist is only an indicator of the need for a full assessment, and not an indicator of eligibility.
The Checklist threshold has been set intentionally low; the significant majority of people who have a positive Checklist and are then fully assessed for CHC will be found not to be eligible. Please refer to paragraphs 85, 87 and 95 in the National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS-funded Nursing Care (Revised 2018).
</p>
						
								
						<p>It is important for practitioners to explain that:
							<dl>
								<dt>If the individual does not ‘screen in’ as requiring a full assessment for CHC, or if they do screen in but are then found not to be eligible for CHC, it does not mean that they won't get any help – it just means that it will not be through CHC.</dt>
								<dt>If the individual ‘screens in’ using the Checklist then their needs will be considered in more detail using the Decision Support Tool (DST). This will be done by at least two professionals – referred to as the ‘multi-disciplinary team’ or MDT.</dt>
								<dt>Only those assessed and found to have a 'primary health need' are eligible for CHC – the term 'primary health need' has a very specific meaning.</dt>
								<dt>Whether someone has a primary health need depends on the type and level of their day to day nursing/healthcare needs. It does not depend on having a particular diagnosis or disability. The vast majority of people who are ill or disabled do not have a primary health need.</dt>
								<dt>The individual / representative will be fully involved in the process, so long as they wish to be, and their views will be heard and questions answered.</dt>
								<dt>The process takes time and will consider the individuals’ current and ingoing needs in depth.</dt>
							</dl>
						</p>
							
								<p><b style="color: #000">Practitioners need to be sensitive to the fact that for some people the CHC assessment process can be upsetting.</b></p>

													<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em"><b style="color: #000">The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS-funded Nursing Care (revised 2018) paragraph 91, makes it clear that there are many situations where it is not necessary to complete a CHC Checklist, including:</b></p>
      												
      												
      												<p>
      												<dl>
      												<em><dt>When it is clear to practitioners working in the health and care system that there is <b style="color: #000">no need for NHS Continuing Healthcare at this point in time.</b> Where appropriate/relevant this decision and its reasons should be recorded. If there is doubt between practitioners a Checklist should be undertaken. </dt>
     												<br>
      												<dt>The individual has <b style="color: #000">short-term health care needs or is recovering from a temporary condition</b> and has <b style="color: #000">not yet reached their optimum potential</b> (if there is doubt between practitioners about the short-term nature of the needs it may be necessary to complete a Checklist).  Please also read ‘Understanding how hospital discharge interacts with CHC’. </dt>
      												<br>
      												<dt>When the individual has been admitted to hospital from a package or residential placement, which all relevant parties agree can still safely and appropriately meet their needs without any changes, then the completion of the Checklist, if required, should take place within 6 weeks of the individual returning to the place from which they were admitted to hospital. </dt>
      												<br>
      												<dt>When it has been agreed by the CCG that the individual should be <b style="color: #000">referred directly for full assessment</b> of eligibility for NHS Continuing Healthcare. 

</dt><br>
      												
      												<dt>If the individual has a <b style="color: #000">rapidly deteriorating condition</b> and may be entering a terminal phase – in these situations the Fast Track Pathway Tool should be used instead of the Checklist. </dt>
      												
      												<br>
      												<dt>An individual is <b style="color: #000">receiving services under Section 117</b> of the Mental Health Act that are meeting all of their assessed needs. </dt>
      													
      													<br>
      												<dt><b style="color: #000">It has previously been decided</b> that the individual is not eligible for NHS Continuing Healthcare and it is clear that there has been no change in needs.</dt>
      												<br>
      												<dt>When a checklist has already been completed and the individual screened out. I.e. FNC review and the individual’s needs have not changed since the last review/checklist.</dt></em>
      												
      												
      												</dl>
      												If it is deemed not necessary to complete a checklist at this time, it should be recorded in the individual’s notes, including the reason/s why, and dated and signed.

      												<h2>Patients in Hospital</h2><br>
													<p>For patients who are in hospital, the process that is most suitable for their current and ongoing needs should be followed.  For guidance on proportionate and timely screening, see paragraphs 88-91 of the National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS-funded Nursing Care (revised 2018). For more detail on how NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) interacts with hospital discharge, see paragraphs 106-117 of the National Framework 2018, remembering that very few patients should be assessed for CHC in an acute setting. For further information, please refer to “Understanding how Hospital Discharge Interacts with Continuing Healthcare”.</p>
<!--For advice refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://s701190940.websitehome.co.uk/chc_deliverymodel_review/docs/understanding_how_hospital_discharge_interacts_with_CHC.pdf" style="color: #000; font-weight: 700;">“Understanding how hospital discharge interacts with Continuing Healthcare”</a></p>-->
   											
   												
   												<p>Paragraph 109 of the National Framework 2018 states <em>‘In the majority of cases, it is preferable for eligibility for NHS Continuing Healthcare to be considered after discharge from hospital when the person’s ongoing needs should be clearer. The aim in most cases will be for the individual to return to the place from which they were admitted to hospital, preferably their own home. It should always be borne in mind that an assessment of eligibility for NHS Continuing Healthcare that takes place in an acute hospital might not accurately reflect an individual’s longer-term needs. This could be because, with appropriate support, the individual has the potential to recover further in the near future. It could also be because it is difficult to make an accurate assessment of an individual’s needs whilst they are in an acute services environment.’</em></p>

      													<p>It must be remembered that consent is not required to process personal data for CHC purposes – this can be carried out using the public task/official authority and provision of healthcare processing conditions. Using consent as the basis for processing personal data will mean that you give the patient the right to withdraw that consent at any time and in any form (verbal or written). If they do this, you cannot switch to a different processing condition to carry on providing CHC assessment and care and circumvent the wishes of the patient.</p>	
						
							<p>However, you will still need to obtain consent to satisfy the Common Law Duty of Confidence, and it is important to be clear that you are obtaining consent for Confidentiality and not processing. You will still need to inform the patient about the use if their information, so they can give their consent based on what they expect to happen.</p>

      													<h2>Principles of consent</h2><br>
      												<p>The Checklist is the NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) screening tool which can be used in a variety of settings to help practitioners identify individuals who may need a full assessment of eligibility for NHS Continuing Healthcare. It is essential that the appropriate consent is sought prior to commencing this process, not for GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation) but for the requirements of the common law duty of confidentiality and for medico-legal reasons. </p>	
						
						<p>Following the implementation of GDPR through the Data Protection Act 2018, consent is not required for the processing of someone’s health information for the purposes of providing health or social care. However, the policy position is that consent is still required for other reasons, not least because people other than health and social care professionals may be involved in the CHC assessment process and because a core principle is transparency and involvement of the individual/their representative.</p>
						
							<h2>Principles of consent</h2>	
							<p>Where the individual has capacity, their consent to share confidential information outside those professionals involved in the assessment should be obtained <b style="color: #000">before</b> the start of the process</p>
							
							<h2>For consent to be valid it must be:</h2>
											
											<dl>
												<dt>Explicit</dt>
												<dt>Specific</dt>
												<dt>Informed</dt>
												<dt>Freely given</dt>
												<dt>Able to be withdrawn</dt>
										
											</dl>
									
								<p>The CCG has a duty to assess if someone may be eligible for CHC. The assessment information will be held by the CCG for as long as is necessary, depending on the circumstances. GDPR does not require consent for professionals to hold this information. </p>
								
								<p>However, there may be confidential information about the individual shared outside the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) who are carrying out the assessment (e.g. with friends or family of the individual). Consent from the individual to share that confidential information with them should be sought in the usual way; professionals need to be mindful of the common law duty of confidentiality, which still applies, and because the CHC assessment process should be as transparent and explicit as possible. </p>
								
								<p>If an individual with capacity does not consent to their information being shared for CHC, the potential consequences of this should be carefully explained. This might affect the ability of the NHS and the local authority to provide appropriate services to them.</p>
								
								<p>The fact that an individual declines to be assessed for CHC does not, in itself, mean that a local authority has an additional responsibility to meet their needs, over and above the responsibility it would have had if they had been assessed for CHC.</p>
								
								<p>Where there are concerns that an individual may have significant ongoing needs, and that the level of appropriate support could be affected by their decision to withhold consent to sharing confidential information, the appropriate way forward should be considered jointly by the CCG and the local authority, taking account of each organisation’s legal powers and duties. It may be appropriate for the organisations involved to seek legal advice (refer to Practice Guidance note 5 and 6 of the National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS-funded Nursing Care (revised 2018) for more information).</p>

      												<h2>Mental Capacity - 5 principles</h2><br>
													<p><em>If there is a concern that the individual may not have capacity to give consent to the assessment process or the sharing of information, this should be determined in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the associated code of practice.</em></p>
					
							</div>
				
						
													<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em"><b style="color: #000">Five principles of the Act: </b></p>
							
							<dl>
												<dt><em>A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that they lack capacity. </em></dt>
								
												<dt><em>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help them to do so have been taken without success. </em></dt>
								
								<dt><em>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because they make an unwise decision. </em></dt>
								

								<dt><em>An act done, or decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in their best interests. </em></dt>
								
								<dt><em>Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action. </em>
(Paragraph 74 National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS-funded Nursing Care (revised 2018)).
</dt>
												
											</dl>
											
								<p><em>It is important to be aware that just because an individual may have difficulty in expressing their views or understanding some information, this does not in itself mean that they lack capacity to make the decision in question.  Appropriate support and adjustments, for example, using alternative methods of communication, should be made available to the person in compliance with the Mental Capacity Act 2005, and with disability discrimination legislation.</em> (Paragraph 75 National Framework 2018)</p>	
								
								<p>Capacity is both time specific and decision specific.</p>

      													<h2>28 Day Clock Start and Consent Guidance Note</h2><br>
      													<p>NHS England and the Department of Health & Social Care (DHSC) are aware of some inconsistencies in the way that CCGs have been counting the referral-to-decision period for individuals referred for a standard  NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) assessment, in cases where the notification sent to the CCG does not include a signed consent form or the Checklist  is missing other information. This statement is being issued in order to ensure data collection is consistent across all CCGs. </p>
								
								<p>An individual’s entitlement to a timely CHC assessment should not be compromised due to delays in administrative processes. The referral-to-decision clock should start from the earliest notification (to the CCG or person or body acting on behalf of the CCG) that full assessment of CHC eligibility is required (e.g. a positive checklist or other notification that full assessment is required from an appropriate person), irrespective of:</p>
									
									<p>
									a.	whether or not the consent form is included <br>
									b.	whether or not the consent question on page 6 of the Checklist is completed<br>
									c.	whether or not there is any other information missing or any questions unanswered on the Checklist, and<br>
									d.	whether or not there is any further processing or triage required to determine whether the Checklist is positive or negative.<br>
									</p>
										
								<p>The CCG should ensure that any missing information is obtained as swiftly as possible, to allow the CHC referral to proceed to full assessment. The referral-to-assessment clock should not be paused, or the clock-start delayed while this information is being obtained. </p>
								
								<p>NHS England and DHSC strongly emphasise the importance of obtaining consent – paragraph 72 of the National Framework 2018 is clear that consent should be obtained “before the start of the process to determine eligibility for NHS Continuing Healthcare”. CCGs are encouraged to work closely with all organisations and individuals responsible for conducting Checklists to ensure they obtain informed consent before carrying out the Checklist, and that they share this consent with the CCG at the time of making the referral. </p>
								
								<p>NHS England is aware that some CCGs have expressed concerns that in following this guidance, which requires adding patient details to their CHC management system, they will commit an information governance breach; NHS England’s Information and Transparency Group has reviewed this guidance and has confirmed that the guidance is compliant and consistent with information governance (IG) standards. That is, by following this guidance a CCG will not be breaching IG and GDPR standards. </p>
								

								
								<p>For further information regarding the principles of consent please also read the document <a target="_blank" href="http://s701190940.websitehome.co.uk/chc_deliverymodel_review/docs/seeking_consent.pdf">‘Seeking Consent’.</a></p>
